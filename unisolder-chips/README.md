# unisolder-chips

This amazing tool was originally made by MadBekon user on the Dangerous Proto forum. 

Here i'm hosting it with his permission, to make it available to everyone, after the original host went down.

Full credity for the idea and the code goes to him, i'm just the host (well... github is)

Here is the message to which the code was attached, for reference and disclaimers
