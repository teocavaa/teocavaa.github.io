<p>Rs1 - 0.003Ω (WSL36373L000FEA) or 0.004Ω (WSL36374L000FEA) resistor can be used as a shunt. WSL3637 from Vishay is used. I wasn't able to find an equivalent part that would have a similar package. If you use 0.003 ohm shunt, R37 and R42 have to be both 1.5kΩ 0.1%. If you use 0.004Ω shunt, R37 and R42 have to be both 2.0kΩ 0.1%.</p>
