<p>Ensure to get a SSD1306 128x64 oled. It is mainly available in a 0.96" size. I've used this part with success: DD-12864WE-4A. However, user SZ64 from the forum was able to get a 1.3" display (UG-2864KSWLG01) and confirmed that it is pin to pin compatible, and needs 12V. Users NECHTO and afedorov patched the firmware to work with SH1106 displays, patches can be found in this forum post and recompiled firmware in this other post.</p>
