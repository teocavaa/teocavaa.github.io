<p>SR580 means "Schottky rectifier, 5A, 80V". There's nothing special about these diodes. Just use 5A 80V Schottky in a DO-201 package.
    This part can be substituted with SB5100 or other Schottky Rectifiers with at least 5A current capability and at least 80V forward voltage. However the 80V part is still preferable, because it will have less forward drop.</p>
